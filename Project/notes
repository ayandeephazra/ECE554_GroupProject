Instructions are flushed only when BRANCH IS TAKEN
because Erics proc was coded based on an branch not taken assumption
I need to modify the flushing to depend on what the prediction was
Example: Need to flush whenevr the prediction is wrong
Whether that is branch taken or not taken

Need to pipe hit into EX stage
if it was a hit -- I predicted branch taken
then flowchange is just ~flowchange
  if b eq -- case 001
    bnt: flow change is normally just zero flag - if Z then flow change else dont flow change
    bt: now it would be ~Z -- if Z then dont flow change (because you already assumed this)
if it was a miss -- I predicted branch not taken
then flowchange is the same
